# ShinyConf2024 workshop: Modular App Blue print

This repository contains the code for the ShinyConf2024 workshop on building modular Shiny apps. The workshop will be held on the 17th of April, 2024 📅.

## About the data

In this workshop, we will be using data related to Women's International Football results ⚽️. The data is available in the `data` folder and it contains some pre-processing. The data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/womens-international-football-results?resource=download).

## Shiny courses

Want to keep learning? We are launching two online courses that are all about Shiny ✨:

- The [ProductioniZing Shiny Course](https://athlyticz.com/shiny-ii), during which you will learn everything about Shiny: from building your first app to testing and deployment 🚀.
- The [CustomiZing WidgetZ Course](https://athlyticz.com/shiny-iii), which is all about creating outstanding user interfaces with Shiny. During this course you will build your own Shiny package and some very cool widgets.
