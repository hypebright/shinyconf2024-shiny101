## Shiny courses

Want to keep learning? We are launching two online courses that are all about Shiny ‚ú®:

- The [ProductioniZing Shiny Course](https://athlyticz.com/shiny-ii), during which you will learn everything about Shiny: from building your first app to testing and deployment üöÄ.
- The [CustomiZing WidgetZ Course](https://athlyticz.com/shiny-iii), which is all about creating outstanding user interfaces with Shiny. During this course you will build your own Shiny package and some very cool widgets.
